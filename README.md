# Psychic-Game

The app randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose.

The app will keep track of the following:

1. Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)

2. Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)

3. Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)

4. Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.)

When the player wins, the Wins counter increases by one and the game starts over again (without refreshing the page).

When the player loses, the Losses counter increases by one and the game restarts without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).
